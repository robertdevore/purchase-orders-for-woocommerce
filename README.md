# Purchase Orders for WooCommerce速

The **Purchase Orders for WooCommerce** plugin adds a "Purchase Order" payment gateway to your WooCommerce store, allowing customers to provide a purchase order number during checkout. 

Ideal for B2B transactions, it simplifies order handling for businesses that process purchase orders without requiring upfront payment.

Unlike the $49/year version from Woo, this plugin is 100% free, fully open source, and highly customizable.
